# The Serviceportal Commons Collection

The Serviceportal is an e-government platform used in the German federal states Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (branded [Service-BW](https://www.service-bw.de/)), Sachsen (branded [Amt 24](https://amt24.sachsen.de/)) and nationwide (branded [OZG-Hub](https://www.ozg-hub.de/)).
This repository contains various classes, methods and tools useful for developing processes on the Serviceportal.

Examples:
- Validators for common use cases in web forms that are not natively included in the Serviceportal (e.g. IBAN, minimum age)
- Methods to dump the content form classes used in the Serviceportal API to text, CSV or HTML.
- A class to quickly create a suitable data source for a Select-Option field listing all countries.

# Usage
You're free to use this repository in the way you find the most useful. You could copy & paste code snippets into your own models if you want. However, we found the best way to ensure your process model stays up-to-date with the latest developments in the Commons collection is by including it into your build pipeline as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

To do so, configure, initialize and update the new git submodule (in the `commons/serviceportal` subfolder):

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/OZG-Hub/serviceportale-commons.git commons/serviceportal
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then ensure the project is included in your build pipeline. If you use gradle, you'd edit `settings.gradle` to add:

```
rootProject.name = '<YOUR_MAIN_PROJECT_NAME_HERE>'
include "commons.serviceportal"
project(':commons.serviceportal').projectDir = new File('commons/serviceportal')
```

And then add the project dependency in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  // all your other dependencies here
  
  // Serviceportal commons collection
  compile project("commons.serviceportal")
}
```
